# SQL to MongoQL Converter

The SQL to MongoQL Translator is a tool developed to facilitate user interaction with MongoDB using SQL queries. It allows users to write SQL queries, which are then validated, parsed, and translated into the appropriate format (MongoQL). The translated queries are executed on the MongoDB server, and the resulting collection of documents is organized in a structure suitable for tabular representation.
